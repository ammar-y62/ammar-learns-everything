# Football Analysis Playground

This project provides an interactive Jupyter Notebook for exploring football data using the `api-football` service. It includes a suite of applications for live scores, team details, match analysis, and more.

## Quick Start

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the `Football_Analysis.ipynb` file.

3.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. The final cell will start an interactive menu that allows you to choose and run the different football applications.
